("Missionaries and Cannibals" problem)
A SOLUZION problem formulation.
The XML-like tags used here may not be necessary, in the end.
But for now, they serve to identify key sections of this
problem formulation. It is important that COMMON_CODE come
before all the other sections (except METADATA), including COMMON_DATA.

This version includes a check for the use of the Tk graphics client.
If this client is being used, then it loads the visualization module:
Missionaries_Array_VIS_FOR_TK.py.
