### Tentative Name
Our decision on the name of this game is **"FATE"**, as we want to give our target audience a message that the outcome of the game will be the ___fate___ of out world if we build our society the way the player did in the game.


### The Setting
Our game timeline starts at ancient time, before any civilization has formed. The player will take a series of operations including burn down trees, build house, mine coal, etc. to develop a civilization. All operations in the game are things we do in real life. The game board is a representation of some elements of our earth. i.e. grass, forest, glacier, and ocean.
