### Tentative Name
Our decision on the name of this game is **"FATE"**, as we want to give our target audience a message that the outcome of the game will be the ___fate___ of out world if we build our society the way the player did in the game.


### The Setting
Our game timeline starts at ancient time, before any civilization has formed. The enviornment condition is optimized. The player will be facing a 10*10 green panel which also inclues 9 blue squares represent ocean and 1 sqaure represents glacier. Player will be able to take a series of operations including burn down trees, build house, mine coal, etc. To develop a civilization, player need to gain population, improve technology stratum, and build seamless interconnections between each operators. All operations in the game are things we participate in real life. The game board is a representation of some elements of our earth. i.e. grass, forest, glacier, and ocean.
