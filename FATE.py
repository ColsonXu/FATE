"FATE is an environmental game. You are the governer of this area.
Let your people live a high quality life so they don't rebel. Also, please
remember to protect the environment from depletion.

The cost and consequence of each operator is shown below:
Burning trees \t no cost \t emit very large amount of CO2
Cutting down trees \t costs 15 gold \t get 5 wood that can be used to build other buildings
Mining \t cost 10 gold \t produce CO2 and earn 10 gold back each year
Build cattle farm \t costs 5 gold and 5 wood \t get 100 food immediately, and get 20 food per year.
Building power plant \t costs 10 gold \t emit CO2, requires one mining for each power plant
Building house \t costs 5 gold \t can contain 150 people, three houses require one power plant

Other tips for you:
1. When temperature gets too high, random forest fire happens. When temperature
gets even higher, shore area gets flooded.
2. Empty space grow back to forest after 3 years.
3. Temperature, whether house has electricity and if houses are enough are factors that
influence the living quality.
4. Mining gives you money! So try mine first!
5. Burning down too much trees causes temperature rises very fast! Don't do that!

Your goal is to hang in there for 45 years! Go ahead!
